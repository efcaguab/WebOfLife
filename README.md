# Web of Life

The <a href="http://www.web-of-life.es" target="_blank">Web of Life</a> provides a graphical user interface, based on Google Maps, for visualizing and downloading data on species interaction networks. It was designed and implemented in a relational database management system, allowing sophisticated and user-friendly cross-search across networks. Users can easily access to the database through any web browser. Data can be downloaded in many file formats, and a data transmission webservice in JavaScript Object Notation is also provided.

### Jupyter Notebook:
The <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter Notebook</a> is an open-source web application for interactive computing across many programming languages.
The notebook provided here uses the <a href="https://irkernel.github.io/" target="_blank">IR kernel</a>: it executes R code which the front-end (Jupyter Notebook) submits to the kernel.

The <a href="https://github.com/miguelfortuna/WebOfLife/blob/master/notebook_R.ipynb" target="_blank">notebook_R.ipynb</a> contains code writen in R to access, download, manipulate, analyze, and plot the species interaction networks stored in the Web Of Life database (a kind of API).
